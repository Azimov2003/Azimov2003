## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Araz, a student from Russia studying economics. I'm just starting my journey as a data analyst / data scientist. I'm excited to learn new things, and I'm always open to new connections and advice from fellow developers and data enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out â€“ I'm happy to collaborate and share knowledge!
